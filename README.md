# DataList

This repository holds all of my work for the DataList project. In this project, I experimented with a Real Estate API that let me fetch real Durham real estate data. I displayed it in a list and added controls so that a user could manipulate what data was being displayed on the screen. I used the Vue framework to create this project.
